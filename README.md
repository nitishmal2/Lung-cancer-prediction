# Lung-cancer-prediction
Lung cancer is the most important reason for death out of all cancers existing
least chance for survival as per the several online cancer communities. The
former medical analysis demonstrated that the detection of lung cancer at a
primitive stage by an appropriate examination pattern is the only solution to
reduce the rate of death due to lung cancer. Radiological screening consumes a
lot of time in addition to the involvement of several medical experts. Because of
this human error can also creep in. Subsequently, the exactness of screening
outcomes prominently relies over the knowledge of doctors. Computer Aided
Detection (CAD) in radiology can deliver a purposeful and beneficial manner in
which doctors focus on enhancing correctness and supporting in identification of
cancer at a primitive stage saving the time and cost of expenditure incurred in
various screening procedures in investigation of cancers.
The Lung databases are taken from the internet source and provided as a source
for processing by the proposed system. Proposed strategy has the following
Phases. Phase one will be Pre-Processing Second one will be the Feature
Extraction Phase, Third Phase will be the Feature Selection and Final Phase will
be Classification and optimization of the Classification Process. Preprocessing of
the vague data is performed for extracting and selecting the features from the
data set. Then with the selected features trained and tested by Logistic
Regression and SVM.

# Technology Used
Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-based interactive
computational environment for creating Jupyter notebook documents.
 # Python
 Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design
philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant
whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help
programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python
is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming
paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural,) object-oriented, and
functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included"
language due to its comprehensive standard library.
Some of the advantages of python are :
➔ Presence of Third Party Modules
➔ Support Libraries
➔ Open Source and Community Development
➔ User-friendly Data Structures
➔ Productivity and Speed
Some of the features of python are :
➔ Easy to code
➔ Free and Open source
➔ Object-oriented language
➔ GUI Programming Support
➔ High-Level Language
➔ Extensible feature
➔ Portable language
➔ Interpreted language
➔ Integrated language
➔ Large Standard library
➔ Dynamically Typed language
